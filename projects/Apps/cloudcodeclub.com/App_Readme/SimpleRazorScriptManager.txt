Easy to use ScriptManager based on Razor Helpers. 
It makes sure each script is only registered once on the page (when needed). Also works for CSS. 

Does NOT include any kind of minification. 

How to use? 

1)Register scripts: 
@Script.AddJavaScript("~/Scripts/jquery.js")

Optionally with a CDN Url:
@Script.AddJavaScript("~/Scripts/jquery.js", "http://cdn_url/jquery.js")

2)Output script tags on MasterPage: 
@Script.OutputJavaScript(). 

For CSS, use:
@Script.AddCss("~/Content/style.css")
@Script.OutputCss()


Web.config setting for CDN scripts: UseCDNScripts
